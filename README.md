# Machine Larning Algorithms 

This repository serves as a personal collection and implementation of various machine learning algorithms. My goal is to build out practical examples and explanations for fundamental ML concepts, making them accessible for learning and reference.


## Progress & What's Inside 

This repository is a work in progress and will be continuously updated with more algorithms over time.

**Currently, you will find implementations and explanations for:**

### ðŸ“Š Linear Regression

* **File:** `Linear-regression.ipynb`
* **Description:** An demonstration of Simple Linear Regression, covering data generation, exploration, model training, prediction, and evaluation. This notebook illustrates how to find the best-fitting straight line to model the relationship between variables.

* **File:** `Iris_flower_classification.ipynb`
* **Description:** An example of classifying the Iris flower dataset using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. This notebook demonstrates a common classification task from data loading to model evaluation, including data exploration, model training, and performance assessment.

## Future

As this repository evolves, I plan to add:

* **More Supervised Learning Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), etc.
* **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:** K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, etc.
* **Ensemble Methods:** Random Forests, Gradient Boosting.
* **Neural Networks:** Basic implementations of neural networks.
* **Detailed Explanations:** Markdown cells within notebooks will provide clear explanations of concepts, formulas, and code.
* **Dataset Variety:** Examples using both synthetic and real-world datasets.
